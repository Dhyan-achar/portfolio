    <p>⏳ Time Management: How to Use Your Time Effectively<br>
Time is one of the most valuable resources we have—especially for students and job seekers. Managing it effectively can be the key to achieving your academic goals, preparing for interviews, or balancing internships and personal life. Here are some practical tips to help you make the most of your time.
<br><br>
1. Set Clear Priorities<br>
Start by identifying what’s most important. Ask yourself: What tasks will bring me closer to my goals? Focus on high-priority activities like studying, applying for jobs, and practicing interview questions.
<br><br>
2. Use a To-Do List or Planner<br>
Make a daily or weekly schedule and stick to it. Tools like Google Calendar, Notion, or even a simple notebook can help keep your tasks organized and visible.
<br><br>
3. Break Tasks into Smaller Steps<br>
Big goals can feel overwhelming. Break them into smaller, manageable steps. For example, instead of “Prepare for technical interview,” break it into “Revise arrays,” “Solve 5 coding problems,” and “Mock interview.”
<br><br>
4. Avoid Multitasking<br>
Doing many things at once often leads to lower-quality work and more stress. Focus on one task at a time and complete it with full attention.
<br><br>
5. Use the Pomodoro Technique<br>
Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. After four sessions, take a longer break. This keeps your mind fresh and focused.
<br><br>
6. Limit Distractions<br>
Put your phone on silent or use apps like Forest or Focus Mode to avoid distractions. A distraction-free environment boosts productivity.
<br><br>
7. Review and Reflect<br>
At the end of the day, review what you accomplished. This helps you track progress and adjust your schedule for the next day.
<br><br><br>
✨ Final Thought<br>
Time management isn’t about doing more—it’s about doing what matters most. With the right habits and mindset, you can make every hour count!
